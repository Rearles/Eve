You:
Let's talk a bit more about you.

Bartender:
Sure, anything in particular?

You:
Anything you'd like to tell me.
I find that the vaguer my questions, the more I'll learn.

Bartender:
Well let's see.
I started working here almost 7 years ago.
It's not a bad job, actually it's pretty good.
The owner pays me much better than most clubs. I try to return the favor by always being friendly with customers.
It seems like that works because we have quite a few repeated customers, and are by far one of the most popular clubs in the district.
That being said, I think some of the management here is a bit backwards.
The owner lets the dancers drink for free here!

You:
Is that a bad thing?

Bartender:
Well for starters, the dancers shouldn't be drinking while their working, it's dangerous.
Also, I make most of my money through tips; if the dancers don't pay, they don't tip.
It also makes it harder for me to keep up with where all my liquor is going if I don't have a reciept.

You:
I see, have you complained to the owner about that?

Bartender:
Of course! He refuses to change that though, says it's good for reeling in customers.
In all my years bartending I've never seen an owner act like that.

You:
Why do you think he acts that way?

Bartender:
I don't know, it sure as hell doesn't make sense to me.
