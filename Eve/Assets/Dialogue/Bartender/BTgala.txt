You:
You mentioned a Gala earlier, what's that got to do with anything?

Bartender:
Ah, our annual Crimson Gala.
I'm not sure what makes it special to the murderers, but we host it every year.
It's quite the event, everyone gets dressed up in special outfits and we decorate the club a deep red.

You:
You decorate the entire club red?

Bartender:
Yep, it sounds strange I know, but the owner says that red is an "alluring" color.
He might be right about that. The Crimson Gala is always our most popular night of the year.
We serve special drinks, and everyone who's anyone will be there, we've already started selling tickets and are almost full.

You:
(Sounds like this would be the perfect night for a murder...)
If it makes so much money, why not have the club do it all the time.

Bartender:
You sure you're a detective? If we hosted a Gala every night, it wouldn't be special.
There's no way we'd make as much money.

You:
I put clues together to save lives; I'll let my accountant handle the money.

Bartender:
Sorry, didn't mean any offence.

You:
None taken, just trying to get as much info as possible.
