You:
You seem to get a lot of human traffic here at the bar. Can you tell me more about some of the workers or customers?

Bartender:
Of course.
The owner is an okay guy. I've been working here for years now and he's never done anything awful.
He pays well and manages the club, but I think there might be something bad between him and the stage director.
The dancers are all alright.
Full honesty, I don't care for them at all, all stuck up pricks if you ask me, but they're part of working in a club
[The Musician] and I are good friends. He started here a little over a year ago. I don't think he's a big fan of this place, but it pays the bills.
As for customers, we have a couple regulars here.
There's a young man who comes in here a couple times a week.
He's got a fiery temper, takes everything as an insult and always seems to be compensating for something.
Always spends a large amount of money on two dancers in particular.
He seems to think he's got an actual chance with them, sorry sap.
Do you know [Boxer], he's a boxer at a nearby ring who sometimes comes around.
He seems decent enough, rarely talks.
There's also a fellow who comes by every now and then.
He's a real big shot, makes a lot of money gambling at a nearby casino.
That being said, he's very smart with his money, and equally cunning.

You:
(Sounds like I'll have to wait to see the customers, but I should be able to go find the boxer now if I want to...)
Thanks for the help.

Bartender:
Of course.
