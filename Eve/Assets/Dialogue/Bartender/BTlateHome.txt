You:
You said you overheard the phone call pretty late in the evening, correct?

Bartender:
Yes, it must have been close to 4am, almost 2 hours after we close

You:
And you said that the reason for picking up the phone was to call your wife. Is this common for you two?

Bartender:
No, this almost never happens.
The club closes at 2am. Since I do most of the cleaning and closing of the night, I usually don't get done until 3am.

You:
So what happened that made you stay later?

Bartender:
We had an especially busy day.
There was a group that came in just before closing and got very drunk.
They were loud and rude, but their pockets were overflowing with money, so the owner told me to suck it up and serve them.
They ended up not leaving until around 2:30.

You:
I see, so that's why you were here late?

Bartender:
Yes. My wife usually waits up for me before going to bed, so that's why I called her

You:
(Sounds like a good relationship, makes me a bit jealous)
