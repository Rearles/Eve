Bartender:
Ah! you must be detective [Name]

You:
Yep, I'm guessing you're [Name]

Bartender:
Thanks for coming, I wouldn't have asked for you if this wasn't very important

You:
Of course, any murder is serious business, but you've got to tell me more. How do you even know a murder is going to happen?

Bartender:
Well... to be completely honest, I don't have any evidence.
Two nights ago as I was trying to place a call to my wife to tell her I'd be home later than usual.
When I picked up the phone I found it was already in use.
I overheard two voices talking.
They mentioned the Gala that's set to take place in one week.
Said it'd be the perfect time for their plan.
I was confused. At first I didn't know what plan they were talking about, but it is true, we do have a Gala coming up.
Then they mentioned murder. Something about revenge.
At this point I realized that one of the people on the phone must be somewhere here in the club with me.
There's only two other phones here. One in the owners office, and one behind the stage.
I quietly put the phone back down to go look for them so I could figure out who it was.
I must have not been as quiet as I thought I was because when I got behind stage, whoever was on the phone had left.
The phone was hanging off the hook though, so I'm sure they must have been there!

You:
(Hmm... so there might be two murderers involved in this case...)

Bartender:
I went and talked to the owner about cancelling the Gala, but he said that was insane, and that he wouldn't do it without concrete evidence.
That's why I hired you.
I'm sorry I don't know much more than that, but you should ask around.
The owner knows the most of what's going on around here.
[Main Dancer] is who you'll want to talk to if you want to know more about people. She's the clubs most popular dancer and she knows it.
Also if you've got a minute, you could talk to [Musician], he's the musician here and a good friend of mine.

{Options}
Go talk to the Owner
Go talk to [Main Dancer]
Go talk to [Musician]
Stay and question the bartender further
